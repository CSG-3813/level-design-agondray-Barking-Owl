# Game Design Brief
**Title:** Ruins of AgonDray  
**Genre:** RPG  
**Platform:** PC/Web  
**Target Audience:** E for Everyone  

**Game Concept:** A 3D, third-person adventure game, in which the player moves around a castle dungeon battling enemies and bosses as they make their way to find stolen treasure. The objective may change in which the player must acquire relics in order to discover the secret behind the dragon's dungeon.

**Premise:** You are an explorer robot and your task is to explore an abandoned cave - what appears to be a dungeon that holds many questions and you must collect the answers by acquiring artifacts. These artifacts will help you not only defeat the guardian of the AgonDray ruins but will also get you out of here, as you find yourself caved in from behind and whatever you have at your disposal alone is not enough to clear the rubble. These artifacts, and whatever the Guardian is guarding, will ensure your safe departure. Your robot is not able to jump - and as it is for exploration purposes only, it's also not able to fight back, you must use its motors to avoid enemies and defeat the Guardian in an unconventional manner.

**Objectives:**
- Main Objective: Collect the relics and get out of the cave safely. These relics are keys and also seem to invigorate the robot with no cost if the robot is hit - that is, the robot will not lose relics if they're hit.
- Sub-Objectives: Avoid the Guardian's minions and the Guardian itself.

**Level Details:**
- 10-room dungeon that consists of square rooms.
- Rooms are connected by hallways.
- Rooms/hallways are separated by doors (with one exception).
- The final room contains a boss. Since there is no combat mechanic this enemy is meant to be avoided, but is distinguished by its size and its speed, as well as being accompanied by two minions.
- The fifth room likewise contains a larger enemy, but is defeated more simply by collecting the relic in the room. 
- The transition from the 7th to 8th rooms is marked by a simple puzzle.
- Level make use of repeating elements such as pillars or light rods.

**Game Controls:** The player is controlled by the WASD or arrow keys to move, and the mouse to look around. Shift to sprint.

**Game Flow and Mechanics:** When the game starts, the player is before the entrance of the dungeon with the entrance behind them caved in. They need to head through the level and acquire artifacts and avoid enemies (but they may have the chance to fight back) all throughout - up to and including the Guardian. While the player has no checkpoints nor lives, they can take extra hits by collecting relics.
